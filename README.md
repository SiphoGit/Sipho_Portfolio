>> `BEST WITH LIGHT-MODE`
>> `FORK & STAR THIS PROJECT. USE IT AS YOUR BEGINNERS DATA SCIENCE PROJECT`

## Project Synopsis

* Created a tool that estimates Data Science salaries *{Mean Absolute Error(MAE) ~ $ 11K}* to help rookie Data Scientists negotiate their income with correct stats when they get a job.
* Using **Python & Selenium**, created an automated scraper which scraped over 1000+ job descriptions from *GlassDoor*
* Introspected features from the text inputs provided in each job description to quantify what values/skills MNCs put on **Python, MS-Excel, AWS, & Spark**.
* Optimized **Linear, Lasso, & Random Forest Regressors** using **GridsearchCV & Scikit-Learn** to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing Representational State Transfer API using Flask.
