# [Project 1: Data-Science-Salary-Estimator](https://github.com/VivanVatsa/Data-Science-Salary-Estimator)
>> `BEST WITH LIGHT-MODE`
>> `FORK & STAR THIS PROJECT. USE IT AS YOUR BEGINNERS DATA SCIENCE PROJECT`

## Project Synopsis

* Created a tool that estimates Data Science salaries *{Mean Absolute Error(MAE) ~ $ 11K}* to help rookie Data Scientists negotiate their income with correct stats when they get a job.
* Using **Python & Selenium**, created an automated scraper which scraped over 1000+ job descriptions from *GlassDoor*
* Introspected features from the text inputs provided in each job description to quantify what values/skills MNCs put on **Python, MS-Excel, AWS, & Spark**.
* Optimized **Linear, Lasso, & Random Forest Regressors** using **GridsearchCV & Scikit-Learn** to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing Representational State Transfer API using Flask.


## [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier)
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
